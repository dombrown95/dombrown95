## ✍️ My Journey So Far
Before transitioning into software, I worked as a technical author in the FinTech industry. I've written developer documentation, tested APIs using Postman, collaborated via GitHub and contributed to external and internal systems using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

That experience taught me to **communicate technical ideas clearly**, which now helps me write better code, explain my thinking and work effectively in agile teams.
